`Waartaa <https://www.waartaa.com/>`_, a web based IRC client as a service,
started out as a tool for people to stay online on IRC 24x7 along with
centralized logging, notifications on mentions and unique identity across
multiple devices. Waartaa applied to GSoC this year under
`The Fedoraproject <http://fedoraproject.org/>`_.

As soon as we proposed the idea, it received an overwhelming response
from the aspiring GSoC'ers. Waartaa received quite a few applications and the
mentors had a hard time selecting the best proposal out of it. The ideas
proposed were:

- Build a central hub for searching/reading channel logs for Open Source
  communities and projects.
- Build a faster and scalable backend.
- Freedom of choice: Expose an API so that users can use their existing
  IRC clients with waartaa.
- Find a secure way to authenticate with IRC services without storing
  RAW passwords.
- Respect user privacy: user personal messages should be stored in an
  encrypted format in the server.
- Allow users to download chat logs in various formats compatible with
  popular IRC clients.
- HTML5 mobile app
- VCS, Bugzilla and other task management tools integration.
- Video/audio conference facility on top of HTML5 and JS technologies.

`Lalit Khattar <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Dne0>`_, an undergraduate
student of Metallurgical Department of IIT Roorkee, India got selected as the
GSoC 2014 candidate for Waartaa.

He will be building central hub for searching/reading channel logs for Open
Source communities and projects, basic integration of Video/Audio conference
facility using WebRTC and admin pages for Waartaa.

What could be a better way to spend the community bonding period than
starting to contribute code to the project even before the actual GSoC
starts? Lalit started to work on writing tests for Waartaa and this'd
give him a better idea of the codebase. He will be going to start with
implementing his proposed project idea as soon as the GSoC Coding Period
starts. The next three months is going to be an awesome rollercoaster ride
for the mentors and the candidate as well.

Happy hacking!
